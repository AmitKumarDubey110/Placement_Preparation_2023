/*
A bracket is considered to be any one of the following characters: (, ), {, }, [, or ].
Two brackets are considered to be a matched pair if the an opening bracket (i.e., (, [, or {) occurs to the left 
of a closing bracket (i.e., ), ], or }) of the exact same type. 
There are three types of matched pairs of brackets: [], {}, and ().
A matching pair of brackets is not balanced if the set of brackets it encloses are not matched. 
For example, {[(])} is not balanced because the contents in between { and } are not balanced. 
The pair of square brackets encloses a single, unbalanced opening bracket, (, and the pair of parentheses 
encloses a single, unbalanced closing square bracket, ].
By this logic, we say a sequence of brackets is considered to be balanced if the following conditions are met:
* It contains no unmatched brackets.
* The subset of brackets enclosed within the confines of a matched pair of brackets is also a matched pair of brackets.
Given n strings of brackets, determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. 
If a string is balanced, print YES on a new line; otherwise, print NO on a new line.
Input Format
The first line contains a single integer,n, denoting the number of strings.
Each line of the subsequent lines consists of a single string,s, denoting a sequence of brackets.
Constraints
* 1 <= n <= 10^3
* 1 <= length(s) <= 10^3 where length(s) is the length of the sequence
Each character in the sequence will be a bracket (i.e., {, }, (, ), [, and ]).
